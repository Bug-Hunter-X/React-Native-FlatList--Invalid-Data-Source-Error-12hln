The corrected code ensures that the `data` prop is a properly formatted array of objects.  Each object should contain the necessary keys expected by the `renderItem` function to avoid the error.  For example, if the `renderItem` function expects keys like `id` and `title`, then the data array must contain objects structured as such:

```javascript
const data = [
  { id: 1, title: 'Item 1' },
  { id: 2, title: 'Item 2' },
  { id: 3, title: 'Item 3' },
];
```

Additional checks and input validation in the component's logic can prevent the error by catching incorrect data before it reaches the `FlatList` component. The `renderItem` function should explicitly handle the case of missing or unexpected keys.
